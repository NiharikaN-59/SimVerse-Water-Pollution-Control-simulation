Water Pollution Control Simulator is an educational tool designed to show the impact of industrial and agricultural activities on local water bodies.

**• Industrial Discharge:** 
    High levels lead to rapid chemical pollution.

**• Agricultural Runoff:**
    Causes nutrient overload, reducing Dissolved Oxygen.

**• Oxygen (DO):**
    If it drops below 4.0 mg/L, the ecosystem enters 'Hypoxia', killing fish.
    
**• Policies:**
    Investing in infrastructure and regulation is key to long-term sustainability.
